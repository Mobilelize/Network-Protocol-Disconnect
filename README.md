# Network-Protocol-Disconnect

Network Protocol Disconnect is a Fabric mod designed to enhance your multiplayer experience by preventing automatic disconnections caused by invalid server packets in Minecraft.

In Minecraft 1.20.5, Mojang introduced a change where any invalid data in packets sent from a server would result in an immediate client disconnect, disrupting gameplay and making it difficult to remain connected to servers with imperfect network handling.

With Network Protocol Disconnect, this issue is resolved by overriding the default behavior, allowing the game to continue running even when invalid packets are detected. Instead of disconnecting, the mod ensures no interruptions.

⚠️ Warning: By disabling the disconnect feature, you may remain connected to servers sending faulty or malicious packets. Use this mod at your own risk, especially when playing on untrusted or unknown servers. Always ensure you play on reputable servers to avoid potential security issues.

Ideal for players encountering frequent disconnects on modded or unstable servers!
